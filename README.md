# gb-bootroms

Disassemblies of the different Game Boy boot ROMs.

## Building

Make sure to clone this repo with submodules, and to have [RGBDS](https://rgbds.gbdev.io) v0.6.0 or later installed.

Then simply run `make` in the repo's root directory to build the boot ROMs and check their validity, or `make all` to only do the former.
